# spoke-chrome-extension

**Update**
The askspoke team has an official extension and this probably has not kept up given that it uses old undocumented APIs. Highly recommend using the official extension available [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spoke-browser-extension/jfbjjpjicehbjkilacdnobndjiddilpi)
